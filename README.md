# 3D-Object-Reconstruction

The final aim of the proposed problem is to obtain a 3D reconstruction of a 3D object/scene of your
choice. Which requires to select and calibrate a camera, to select an adequate object/scene according to
some indications, to select an adequate number of views from the object, to extract and match feature
points between views, to compute the fundamental matrix between views, to obtain a 3D points cloud
reconstruction, and finally to represent object geometric elements over this points cloud.
